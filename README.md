### Hi there! 👋

I'm Javier. I work as a full-time software engineer & Analyst. In my spare time I do open-sourcing _(normally it is about 1-2 hours in the morning before the work)_. Most of my open-source projects below 👇🏻 are focused on one thing -  **to help people learn** 📚. You may use these projects to learn about _algorithms in JavaScript_ and get prepared for _technical interviews_, or to learn _Python_ syntax and start experimenting with _machine learning algorithms_ and math behind them, etc. I also write [articles](https://trekhleb.dev/blog/) about life, web-development and machine learning.
